# Smooth dependence of an ODE solution on its initial condition

Picard iteration produces a solution of `γ' = v ∘ γ` continuously, indeed Lipschitzly, in the
initial condition. It says nothing about differentiability: the contraction argument is metric.
This file upgrades continuity to smoothness of the same order as the field, jointly in the initial
condition and in time, near time `0`.

The mechanism is a change of variables that turns the initial condition into a *parameter* of a
new equation, so that `ODE.exists_contDiffAt_picard_solution_of_contDiff` applies. Writing a
solution through `x` as `t ↦ x + u (t / ε)`, the curve `u` solves

`u' s = ε • v (x + u s)`, `u 0 = 0`

on the fixed time interval `[0, 1]`, with `(x, ε)` a parameter and the initial state `0` fixed.
At `ε = 0` that field vanishes identically, which is exactly the degeneracy hypothesis of the
parameterized Picard theorem, and the solution at the base parameter is the constant curve `0`.
Evaluating the resulting smooth family of paths at the endpoint `s = 1` — a continuous linear
map on the path space — produces `x + u 1`, which `ODE_solution_unique` identifies with
the value of the global solution at time `ε`. Both the initial condition and the time are
therefore smooth directions.

## Main results

* `ODE.contDiffAt_globalSolution`: the global solution of a globally Lipschitz `C^(n+1)` field is
  `C^(n+1)` in time and initial condition near time `0`, for `n` finite or infinite.
* `ODE.eventually_contDiffAt_globalSolution`: at every small time, the time-`t` map of such a
  field is `C^(n+1)` in the initial condition.
* `ODE.exists_contDiffAt_localFlow`: a vector field which is `C^(n+1)` on a neighbourhood of a
  point has a local flow through the nearby points which is `C^(n+1)` in time and initial
  condition near that point at time `0`, and which obeys the flow law
  `Φ x (t + u) = Φ (Φ x t) u`.

The local flow produced here is the model-space input to the smooth flow of a vector field on a
manifold, and in particular to the flow of the geodesic spray, whose base curves are the
geodesics of a Riemannian metric.

/-- **The local flow of a smooth vector field.** A field which is `C^(n+1)` on a neighbourhood of
`a` admits a flow `Φ`: a family of curves, one through each point, which start at that point,
obey the flow law `Φ x (t + u) = Φ (Φ x t) u`, depend on the initial condition and the time in a
`C^(n+1)` way near `(a, 0)`, and solve the equation for every initial condition and time in some
neighbourhood of `(a, 0)`. No global hypothesis on the field is needed: a bump function cuts the
field down to a globally Lipschitz one agreeing with it near `a`, and the two fields still agree
along the curves at the times where the equation is claimed. The flow law holds for all times
because `Φ` is the global flow of that cut-off field; only the equation for `v` is local. -/
