# Extending finite-dimensional smooth germs

A function which is smooth, of finite or infinite order, on a neighbourhood of a point of a
finite-dimensional real normed space agrees near that point with a globally smooth function of
the same order. A smooth bump function performs the extension while preserving the original
function near the base point. Since the bump is compactly supported, so is the representative,
and a representative of order at least one is moreover globally Lipschitz.

These general calculus lemmas are used by the parameter-dependent ODE construction for the
Lie-group exponential, and by the construction of a local flow out of the global solution of a
globally Lipschitz field.
